## 🧩 Game Descriptions

### ✏️ Tic-Tac-Toe
A classic 2-player board game where players take turns marking the spaces in a 3×3 grid with "X" or "O". The first player to align three symbols vertically, horizontally, or diagonally wins.

### 🚢 Naval Battle (Battleship)
A strategic guessing game where two players place their ships on a grid and take turns trying to sink each other's fleet by targeting coordinates. This version allows ship placement, attack phases, and victory detection.

### 🏓 Ping-Pong
A simple yet addictive two-player table tennis game. Players control paddles to hit the ball back and forth. The first to score a certain number of points wins the match.
